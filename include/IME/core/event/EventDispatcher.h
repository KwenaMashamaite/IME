/**
 * @class ime::EventDispatcher
 * @ingroup core
 *
 * The global event emitter is available to anything class that needs
 * it (class, function etc..). Its responsibility is to decouple classes
 * from one another. You can emit a signal and anyone listening for that
 * signal will pick it up without knowing and caring where the signal came
 * from. Here is a simple example:
 *
 * @code
 * // main.cpp
 *
 * // We subscribe to a loading event that will be dispatched by some scene
 * // we don't know or care about, we are just interested in knowing that
 * // resource loading is complete
 * EventDispatcher::instance()->onEvent("loadingComplete", Callback<>([&engine] {
 *    engine.popScene();                // Remove the scene that emitted the event
 *    engine.pushScene(gameplayScene);  // Start the gameplay scene
 * }));
 *
 * engine.pushScene(loadingScene);
 * engine.run();
 *
 * // LoadingScene.cpp
 * // ...
 * // The caller does not need to keep asking the loading scene if it has
 * // finished loading the game assets, the scene lets everyone whose is
 * // interested know when it is done without knowing and caring who they are
 *
 * EventDispatcher::instance::dispatchEvent("loadingComplete");
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note This classes instance is accessible from anywhere withing the
 * program, however the instance is destroyed when the last pointer to it
 * goes out of scope. This means that all event listeners that have been
 * registered will be destroyed and a call to dispatchEvent will not do
 * anything. Therefore there must be at least one pointer to the class
 * instance that keeps it alive for as long as its being used. The Engine
 * keeps an instance alive for as long as it is running, therefore you
 * should use the global dispatcher only when the engine is running or keep
 * an instance alive yourself
