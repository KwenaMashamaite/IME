     * @brief A layer for drawable entities
     *
     * Typically you add objects that should be drawn together to the
     * same layer. The order in which render layers are rendered is
     * specified in the RenderLayerContainer. Objects in the same layer
     * can also be sorted. For example, you may have a background layer
     * which has mountains, trees and valleys. However you don't want the
     * objects to be drawn non-deterministically. You can specify which
     * objects are drawn over which and which objects are drawn under which
     * by specifying the render order of the object when adding it to the
     * layer. Objects with the lowest render order are drawn first whilst
     * objects with the highest render order are drawn last. When objects
     * have the same render order, the object that was added first to the
     * layer will be rendered first.
     *
     * By default, all objects have the same render order, as a result, they
     * are drawn in the order in which they were added to the layer
     *
     * A layer is not instantiated directly but rather using a
     * ime::RenderLayerContainer::create
