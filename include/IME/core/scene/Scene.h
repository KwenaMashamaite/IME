/**
 * @class ime::Scene
 * @ingroup core
 *
 * A ime::Scene represents a distinct state of your game, for example
 * loading, main menu, gameplay, paused and so on. All game scenes
 * exist in isolation and have no knowledge of each other. Only
 * one scene can be active at a time. For example, the game cannot
 * be in a main menu state and a gameplay state at the same time.
 *
 * The transition between scenes is managed using the Last In First
 * Out (LIFO) technique (The same way std::stack works). Therefore
 * you cannot transition between scenes at random. The order in which
 * scenes are added to the Engine is important.
 *
 * For example, if while in the "gameplay" scene, you push a "pause" scene
 * to the game engine, the "gameplay" scene will be paused (onPause called)
 * and the "pause" scene will be entered (onEnter called on the pause scene
 * instance) and the "pause" scene will become the active scene (gets system
 * events, updates and rendered). If you pop the "pause" scene, the engine
 * will destroy it (onExit called on the pause scene instance) and return
 * to the "gameplay" scene (onResume called on the gameplay scene instance).
 * However, if you push (transition to) another scene while in the "pause"
 * scene, the process repeats; the "pause" scene gets paused and the the new
 * scene becomes active)
 *
 * Usage example:
 * @code
 * class StartUpScene : public ime::Scene {
 *      void onEnter() override {
 *          ime::ui::Label::Ptr greeting = ime::ui::Label::create("Thank you for using Infinite Motion Engine");
 *          greeting->setOrigin(0.5f, 0.5f);
 *          greeting->setPosition("50%", "50%");
 *          getGui().addWidget(std::move(greeting), "lblGreeting");
 *      }
 * }
 *
 * ...
 *
 * engine.pushScene(std::make_unique<StartUpScene>());
 * @endcode
