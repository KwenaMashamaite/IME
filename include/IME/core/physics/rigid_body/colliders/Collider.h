     * @brief Holds collision filtering data for a collider
     *
     * Collision filtering allows you to disable or enable collisions
     * between colliders. Collision filtering is achieved through
     * categories and groups. For each collider you can specify which
     * category it belongs to. You also specify what other categories
     * this collider can collide with. For example, you could specify
     * in a multiplayer game that all players don't collide with each
     * other and monsters don't collide with each other, but players
     * and monsters should collide. This is done with masking bits.
     * Note that there are 16 collision categories and group filtering
     * has higher precedence than category filtering.
     *
     * Additional collision filtering occurs implicitly:
     *
     * 1. A collider on a static body can only collide with a dynamic body.
     * 2. A collider on a kinematic body can only collide with a dynamic body.
     * 3. Colliders on the same body never collide with each other.
     * 4. You can optionally enable/disable collision between colliders on
     *    bodies connected by a joint.
