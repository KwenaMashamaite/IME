     *
     *  i)  -1: Ignore the current collider and continue with the ray casting.

     * any collider, ray cast all colliders, or ray cast the closest collider.

     * first arg:  The collider that is currently colliding with the ray
     * second arg: The point of initial intersection (There may be more
