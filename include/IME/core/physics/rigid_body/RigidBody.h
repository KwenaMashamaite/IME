    /**
     * @brief A rigid body
     *
     * Bodies have position and velocity. You can apply forces, torques, and
     * impulses to bodies. Bodies can be static, kinematic, or dynamic:
     *
     * 1. A static body does not move under simulation and behaves as if it
     *    has infinite mass.
     *
     * 2. A kinematic body moves under simulation according to its velocity.
     *    Kinematic bodies do not respond to forces
     *
     * 3. A dynamic body is fully simulated. They can be moved manually by the
     *    user, but normally they move according to forces
     *
     * Note that a rigid body without a Collider attached to it will not be
     * able to collide with other rigid bodies. This means that it will not
     * generate a collision when it overlaps with another rigid body. A
     * Collider must be attached to the rigid body if you want the body to
     * react to physics (gravity, friction, applied forces, impulses etc...)
     * and also be able to collide with other rigid bodies. In addition a
     * rigid body does not have a shape or size, the shape and the size of
     * the body are derived from the body's Collider. As a result, when debug
     * drawing is enabled, rigid bodies without colliders will not be rendered
     * on the render window
     *
     * A body is not constructed directly, use the PhysicsEngine::createBody function
     * to construct a rigid body
