     * @brief Controls the reaction of ime::RigidBody objects when they collide
     *
     * When a collision is detected between two rigid bodies, a calculation
     * is performed to resolve the collision (push the two bodies such that
     * they no longer overlap). This calculation is performed by an iterative
     * solver. The solver determines if and how the velocity and position of
     * the two bodies should change. For example, when a ball hits a wall, it
     * should as expected, bounce of the wall. A single iteration per update
     * may not give accurate results as you may still see the ball overlap the
     * wall. The velocity and position iterations affect the accuracy of the
     * physics simulation.
     *
     * There is a trade-off between performance and accuracy when selecting
     * the iterations. Using fewer iterations increases performance but
     * accuracy suffers. Likewise, using more iterations decreases performance
     * but improves the quality the simulation simulation. You can play around
     * with different combinations and observe how your simulations improves
     * or degrades.
     *
     * @note Physics iterations are only valid for collision resolution between
     * ime::RigidBody objects with ime::Collider attached to them. If your game
     * does not make use of them, for example your only interested in grid-based
     * physics (see ime::GridMover), then these values should be set to zero
