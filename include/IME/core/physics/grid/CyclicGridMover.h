     * When there is a an obstacle game object (see ime::GridObject::setObstacle)
     * or a collidable tile in the targets direction of cycle, this grid mover
     * basically behaves like a wall follower (when the cycle direction is set
     * to clockwise, it behaves like a right wall follower and when the cycle
     * direction is set to anti-clockwise, it behaves like a left wall follower).
     * In the absence of a collidable tile or an obstacle game object, the target
     * will switch between four adjacent tiles in the chosen cycle direction.
     *
     * Note that this grid mover cannot get the target out of a dead-end. If
     * the Grid2D contains dead-ends and you intend for the target to never
     * get stuck at any point in the grid, then you should consider removing
     * them or using a different GridMover.
