     * @brief Abstract base class for image containers
     *
     * A sprite image is a collection of smaller images packed together into
     * a single image. The sub-images may be of the same size or of varying
     * dimensions. In addition, the sub-images may be arranged in grid
     * formation or tightly packed next to each other in the sprite image. A
     * sprite image simplifies file management and increases performance as we
     * only have to deal with a single texture instead of multiple textures.
     * For example, imagine a character which has a walking and running animation
     * in all four directions (Up, right. down and left) and each animation has
     * 15 frames. This would require 120 individual images files!. With a sprite
     * image all that information can be stored in a single image file and accessed
     * later using coordinates or indexes
