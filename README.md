# IME â€” Infinite Motion Engine

IME is a state-based game engine for developing 2D games. It is written in C++17.

## Features

* **Graphics** - Render Window, Tilemap, Animatable Sprites, 2D camera, Spritesheet, etc...
* **GUI** - Label, Button, Checkbox, MenuBar, and much more
* **Animations** - 2D animations which support both spritesheet and texture atlas
* **Physics** - Path finding, Grid based movement, Grid cell based collisions, Rigid body physics engine,
  Collision detection using contact callbacks
* **Input** - Keyboard, Mouse and Joystick support
* **Sound** - Music and Sound effects support
* **Event system** - Thread safe event system
* **Asset management** - Automated resource management system
* **Time** - Schedule one time, repeating or indefinite callbacks

*IME does not support an Editor by default*

## Demos

Here is a list of games developed with IME:

1. [1980's Pac-Man arcade game clone](https://github.com/KwenaMashamaite/PacMan)

## Downloads

_**Note that from `v2.4.0`, IME no longer provides precompiled `MinGW 7.3.0` binaries**_

The latest official precompiled IME binaries can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/KwenaMashamaite/IME/releases/tag/v2.4.0).
To use the library you must have a supported (GCC or VC++) C++17 compliant compiler.
Available binaries are compiled with `GCC MinGW 10.3.0` and `Microsoft Visual C++ 16 2019`
compilers. This means that in order to use them, you must have the exact compiler on your system.
If you want to use different versions of the above compilers, then you have to [build](#Build) the
library yourself.

## Installation

_**Note that from `v2.4.0`, IME no longer provides `static` binaries nor support it**_.

1. Using CMake

If you install IME in a known location, usually `Program Files (x86)`, you don't have to
set `IME_DIR`, *CMake* will automatically find the library

```cmake
# Find IME
set(IME_DIR "your_path_to_IME_directory_here/lib/cmake/IME") # Skip if IME installed in known location
find_package(IME 2.4.0 REQUIRED)

# Link IME
target_link_libraries (myGame PRIVATE ime)
```
<br>

After successfully building your game executable, copy the contents of `IME/bin` folder to the
folder in which your game executable resides. If your current `BUILD_TYPE` is **Debug**, then copy
the contents of `IME/bin/Debug` and if it is **Release**, then copy the contents of `IME/bin/Release`.
For `GCC MinGW` compilers, you must also copy the contents of `IME/bin/Runtime` to your game executables
folder. For `VC++` compilers, you should only copy the contents of `IME/bin/Runtime` if you don't have
[Visual C++ Redistributable Runtimes](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0)
installed on your system. 

##  Build

If you want to use *IME* with a different compiler, then you must build it yourself:

1. Clone the repository
```git
$ git clone https://github.com/KwenaMashamaite/IME
```

2. Download and Install [CMake 3.17+](https://cmake.org/)
3. Download and install *IME*'s dependencies: [SFML 2.5.1](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php), [TGUI 0.9.1](https://tgui.eu/), and [Box2d 2.4.1](https://box2d.org/) <br>
   The dependencies must have a matching compiler and architecture (e.g, If you intend to build *IME* with <br>
   `Visual C++ 15 2017 (32-bit)`, then *SFML*, *TGUI* and *Box2d* binaries must all be compiled with `Visual C++ 15 2017 (32-bit)`
   <br>

4. Run the following commands from the project root directory:

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
cmake --install . --prefix "directory_where_you_want_the_library_to_be_installed_after_build"
```

You can leave out `--prefix "installation_directory"` and *CMake* will install the library to a known
location, usually `Program Files (x86)\IME`. However, this may require admin privileges
